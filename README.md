This [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script hides answers in Q&A sections of web pages.

The questions and answers on the web page must start with `Q.` resp. `A.`. The Q&A sections must be surrounded by `Test yourself` and `End.`.

Works with [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) for Firefox and Google Docs as well.

Example:

# Test yourself

Q. How are you?

A. Fine.

Q. How are you doing?

A. 42.

End.
